    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>For the Coffee Mixture:</h3>
        <li>1 1/2 cups strong brewed coffee, cooled</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons coffee liqueur (optional)</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
        <h3>For the Tiramisu Layers:</h3>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 package of ladyfingers (about 24)</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate shavings (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brew the Coffee: Prepare strong coffee and let it cool to room temperature. You can add coffee liqueur and sugar to the coffee, adjusting the sugar to your taste. This will be the coffee mixture for dipping the ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Make the Mascarpone Filling: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar until the mixture becomes pale and slightly thickened. Add the mascarpone cheese and mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li>Whip the Cream: In a separate mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Combine Mascarpone and Whipped Cream: Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture until fully incorporated. Be gentle to keep the mixture light and airy.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Tiramisu: Take a serving dish or individual glasses. Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture (don't soak them) and layer them in the bottom of the dish.</li>
        <li>Layer the Cream: Spread a layer of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat the process with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture until you run out of ingredients, finishing with a layer of the mascarpone mixture on top.</li>
        <li>Chill: Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
        <li>Dust with Cocoa: Just before serving, dust the top with unsweetened cocoa powder using a fine sieve or sifter. You can also add dark chocolate shavings for an extra touch of decadence if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve: Slice and serve the Tiramisu chilled. It's best enjoyed cold and can be garnished with a sprig of mint or additional chocolate shavings for presentation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Tiramisu is a delightful dessert that combines the richness of mascarpone with the subtle bitterness of coffee, creating a creamy and heavenly treat that's perfect for special occasions or any time you crave a taste of Italy.</p>
