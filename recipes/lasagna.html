    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Boil the Noodles: Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set them aside. You can also use no-boil noodles if preferred.        
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until they are soft and fragrant. Add the ground meat and cook until it's browned and cooked through, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat if needed. Season the meat with Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. If you like some heat, you can also add red pepper flakes. Optionally, deglaze the pan with a splash of red wine. Stir in the tomato sauce and tomato paste. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture: In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with an egg and season with salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe (usually around 350°F or 175°C).</li>
        <li>Layer the Lasagna: In a large baking dish, begin assembling the lasagna. Start with a thin layer of meat sauce to prevent sticking, then add a layer of lasagna noodles. Next, spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Repeat the layers until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with a final layer of meat sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lasagna is heated through and the cheese is bubbly and golden.</li>
        <li>Rest and Serve: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley before serving if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Serve your homemade lasagna with a side of garlic bread or a fresh salad. Enjoy your delicious, cheesy, and comforting meal!</li>
