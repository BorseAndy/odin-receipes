    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A double cheeseburger: Juicy beef, double cheese, fresh veggies, and toasted bun -> pure comfort in a bun!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Cheese slices (e.g., American, cheddar)</li>
        <li>Burger buns</li>
        <li>Toppings and condiments (e.g., lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, pickles)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Grill or Skillet: Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. Make sure it's hot before cooking the burgers.</li>
        <li>Form Patties: Divide the ground beef into four equal portions (for two double cheeseburgers). Take one portion and form it into a patty, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Season both sides of the patty with salt and pepper. Repeat for the remaining portions.</li>
        <li>Cook Patties: Place the patties on the hot grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side for medium-rare to medium doneness. Add a slice of cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to let it melt.</li>
        <li>Toast the Buns: While the patties are cooking, split the burger buns and lightly toast them on the grill or in a toaster until they are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Assemble Burgers: Once the patties are cooked and the cheese is melted, remove them from the grill or skillet. Place the bottom half of each bun on a plate. Layer with lettuce, tomato slices, onion (if desired), and any other condiments you prefer.</li>
        <li>Add Patties: Place one patty on each bun, on top of the veggies and condiments.</li>
        <li>Stack Second Patty: Place a second patty on top of the first one, creating a double cheeseburger.</li>
        <li>Top with Bun: Finish by placing the top half of the bun on the stack.</li>
        <li>Serve: Your double cheeseburger is ready to be served! You can use a toothpick or a skewer to help hold the layers together if needed.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Enjoy your homemade double cheeseburger while it's hot and juicy. Serve with your favorite sides like fries or a salad</li>
